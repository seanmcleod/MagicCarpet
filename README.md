The theory is developed for the control characteristics of aircraft in which direct lift is commanded
directly by the pilots' stick. Basic requirements are established for acceptable response characteristics; of
particular importance is the location at which direct lift acts relative to the centre of gravity, the aerodynamic
centre, and manoeuvre point. The affective line of action of the control lift can be controlled by
mechanical interconnections between the conventional pitch control and direct-lift systems. Potential
benefits of direct-lift control include improved precision in landing large aircraft, more effective control
of gust effects, and reduced possibility of stalling.

Maritime augmented guidance with integrated controls for carrier approach and 
recovery precision enabling technologies (MAGIC CARPET) is an enhanced set of flight 
control laws and Head-Up Display symbology for F/A-18E/F/G aircraft which seek to reduce 
the unique pilotage skills required for shipboard landings. Integrated Direct Lift Control 
significantly simplifies ‘ball flying’ by allowing for repeatable and precise flightpath changes 
using lift as directly commanded via longitudinal stick displacements. Additionally, ‘Delta 
Path’ control mode adds a feature that allows the aircraft to capture, maintain, and return 
to the 'ideal' 3.5 degree glideslope, nearly hands off. This essentially de-couples the 
glideslope task from the lineup task. The enhanced HUD symbology provides much 
improved direct pilot feedback cues on the magnitude of glideslope and lineup corrections. 
Recent shipboard flight test completed aboard the USS Bush (CVN-77) in April 2015 
confirmed a 50% reduction in touchdown dispersion as well as greatly reducing overall 
carrier approach workload as observed through real-time pilot feedback. Test results, pilot 
comments and lessons learned will be presented.
